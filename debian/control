Description: Interpreter of object-oriented scripting language Ruby
 Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
 object-oriented programming.  It has many features to process text
 files and to do system management tasks (as in perl).  It is simple,
 straight-forward, and extensible.
 .
 In the name of this package, `1.9.1' indicates the Ruby library
 compatibility version. This package currently provides the `1.9.3'
 branch of Ruby, which is compatible with the `1.9.1' branch.

Package: ri1.9.1
Architecture: all
Depends: ruby1.9.1 (>= ${source:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Ruby Interactive reference (for Ruby 1.9.1)
 ri is a command line tool that displays descriptions of built-in Ruby
 methods, classes, and modules. For methods, it shows you the calling
 sequence and a description. For classes and modules, it shows a
 synopsis along with a list of the methods the class or module
 implements.
 .
 This package provides ri command and descriptions about Ruby 1.9.1.
 This package provides the ri documentation for the Ruby 1.9.1 standard library.
 The ri1.9.1 executable itself is in the ruby1.9.1 package.

Package: ruby1.9.1-full
Architecture: all
Depends: ruby1.9.1 (>= ${source:Version}), libruby1.9.1-dbg (>= ${source:Version}), ruby1.9.1-dev (>= ${source:Version}), ruby1.9.1-examples (>= ${source:Version}), ri1.9.1 (>= ${source:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Ruby 1.9.1 full installation
 For many good reasons, the Ruby programming language is split in many
 small different packages. Installing this package will make sure you have
 all the packages that add up to a full Ruby installation, with the exception
 of the Tcl/Tk bindings for Ruby.
 .
 This package installs the dependencies for Ruby compatibility version 1.9.1
 (currently Ruby 1.9.3).

Package: ruby1.9.3
Architecture: all
Depends: ruby1.9.1 (>= ${source:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: ruby1.9.1-full (>= ${source:Version})
Description: Interpreter of object-oriented scripting language Ruby, version 1.9.3
 Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
 object-oriented programming.  It has many features to process text
 files and to do system management tasks (as in perl).  It is simple,
 straight-forward, and extensible.
 .
 Ruby uses two parallel versioning schemes: the `Ruby library compatibility
 version' (1.9.1 for this package), which is similar to a library SONAME, and
 the `Ruby version' (1.9.3 for this package). Ruby packages in Debian are
 named using the Ruby library compatibility version, which is sometimes
 confusing for users who do not follow Ruby development closely. This package
 depends on the ruby1.9.1 package, and provides compatibility symbolic links
 from 1.9.3 executables and manual pages to their 1.9.1 counterparts.
