ruby1.9.1 (1.9.2~svn28788-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release based on upstream snapshot from the 1.9.2 branch,
    after 1.9.2 RC2. That branch is (supposed to be) binary-compatible
    with the 1.9.1 branch.
    + Builds fine on i386. Closes: #580852.
  * Upgrade to Standards-Version: 3.9.1. No changes needed.
  * Updated generated incs.
  * Patches that still need work:
    + Unclear status, need more investigation:
     090729_fix_Makefile_deps.dpatch
     090803_exclude_rdoc.dpatch
     203_adjust_base_of_search_path.dpatch
     902_define_YAML_in_yaml_stringio.rb.dpatch
     919_common.mk_tweaks.dpatch
     931_libruby_suffix.dpatch
     940_test_thread_mutex_sync_shorter.dpatch
    + Maybe not needed anymore, keeping but not applying.
     102_skip_test_copy_stream.dpatch (test doesn't block anymore?)
     104_skip_btest_io.dpatch (test doesn't block anymore?)
     201_gem_prelude.dpatch (we don't use that rubygems anyway?)
     202_gem_default_dir.dpatch (we don't use that rubygems anyway?)
     940_test_file_exhaustive_fails_as_root.dpatch
     940_test_priority_fails.dpatch
     100518_load_libc_libm.dpatch
  * Add disable-tests.diff: disable some tests that cause failures on FreeBSD.
    Closes: #590002, #543805, #542927.
  * However, many new failures on FreeBSD. Since that version is still an
    improvement, add the check that makes test suite failures non-fatal on
    FreeBSD again. That still needs to be investigated.
  * Re-add 903_skip_base_ruby_check.dpatch
  * Add build-dependency on ruby1.8 and drop all pre-generated files.

ruby1.9 (1.9.0+20060423-3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Make mkconfig.rb understand autoconf >2.59a's new way of doing
    config.status; it inserts #|_!!_|# into the sed lines temporarily, then
    removes them at the end. Since mkconfig.rb only parses these lines instead
    of executing the entire sed script, it has to remove #|_!!_|# by itself.
    This fixes FTBFS with newer autoconf. (Closes: #373953)
